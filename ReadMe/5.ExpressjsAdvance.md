## Middleware
- A middleware function is basically a function that takes the request object and either returns the response to the client or passes control to another middleware function.

- Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.
- ```
    app.get('/api/courses',(req,res) => {
        res.send(courses);
    });
  ```
 - in above example (req,res) is a middleware function
 - When we get a request from the client in server, the request passes to a pipeline named **Request Processing Pipeline**. In this pipeline there one or more Middleware function.
