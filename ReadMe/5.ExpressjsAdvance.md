# Advance Express Javascript
## Middleware
- A middleware function is basically a function that takes the request object and either returns the response to the client or passes control to another middleware function.

- Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.
- ```
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();

    app.use(express.json());

    app.get('/api/courses',(req,res) => {
        res.send(courses);
    });
  ```
 - In above code snippet, there are 2 middleware function
    - app.use(express.json()); - This middleware function returns a function
    - route() - (req,res) - This middleware function returns response
 - in above example (req,res) is a middleware function
 - When we get a request from the client in server, the request passes to a pipeline named **Request Processing Pipeline**. In this pipeline there one or more Middleware function.

## Creating Custom Middleware
- ```
        app.use(function(req,res,next){
            console.log('Logging...');
            next();
        });
    ```
- The above code snippet have a function to which we passes request, response and the reference of the next middleware function going to be called. Because we are not ending the response here.
- When we call next(); after the console, this means we pass controle to the next middleware function in the pipeline.
- If we don't do this, as we are not end the req, res pipeline, our request will hang in there.
- **To see what happens when you comment the next(); Follow the steps**
    - Comment the line next();
    - open terminal type nodemon middlewareExample.js
    - open postmen
    - type http://localhost:3000/api/courses
    - You will see Logging in the command line
    - In postman, it will show loading only, that means it hanged
    - If you oncomment the code, you will get the response
- **Write a next middleware function to pass the control to the next**
- ```
        app.use(function(req,res,next){
            console.log('Logging...');
            next();
        });
        app.use(function(req,res,next){
            console.log('Authenticating...');
            next();
        });
    ```
- Now Follow the above step to run the code and see the output in console and terminal.
- **How to create Logger.js file to store all the middleware function**
    - Create a file logger.js
    - ```
            function log(req,res,next){
                console.log('Authenticating...');
                next();
            }
            module.exports = log;
        ```
    - We Moved the middleware function from the middlewareexample.js
    - Just import the logger file like this to use the middleware function
    - const logger = require('../logger')
    - Use the logger constant like this
    - ```
            instead of this
            app.use(function(req,res,next){
                console.log('Logging...');
                next();
            });
            use this
            app.use(logger);
      ```  
## Built-In Middleware
- In express js there are number of middleware function
- **app.use(express.json())** - It will parse the body of the request and if there is json object it will populate req.body property
- **app.use(express.urlencoded())** - Parses incoming request with url encoded payload.
    - This middleware parse the body and post the response
    - In very request which send a form data, this will how we send "key1=value1&key2=value2"
    - To check how the URL Encoded builtin middleware function works, just follow this
    - open Command Prompt/ terminal
    -  nodemon middlewareBuiltinFunctions.js
    - It will start the Project in 300 port
    - now open Postman
    - Before we select request type POST and in body of the request we send JSON data by selecting raw.
    - As we are using url encoded middleware function
    - select form-url-encoded
    - We will get error like this in command line **body-parser deprecated undefined extended: provide extended option**  
    - We willl use below code
    - ```
            app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: true})); 
        ```
    - As the above code is static, we can put all the hard coded value in separate folder named public
    - ```
            app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: true})); 
        ```    
## Third-Paarty Middleware
- Go to http://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware.html
- You will see the list of third party middle ware functions
- You should use middleware function siely
- If you use more middleware function, it will degrade the performance of the function
- Just check the each middleware functions given in the list.
- Check helmet middleware function
- Go to https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet and check this.
- Install helmet middleware function
## Environments
- If you work on any enterprise application, you will have production and development environment to develop things
- You need to enable or disable few features in production environment
- Here i will explain how to do this.
- **Process** is an object in Express Js which gives access to the current process running
- **process.env.NODE_ENV** - This will return the environment set to the node js
- If the environment is not set, then it will return undefined
- Another way to get the environment
- app.get('env'); - it will return the ENvoronment
- If environment is not set, it will return DEVELOPMENT environment by default

## How to set Environment in command line
- export NODE_ENV=production 
## Configuration
- There are different LIbraries are available for configuration
- rc (https://www.npmjs.com/package/rc)
- npm config (https://www.npmjs.com/package/config)
- install config -> npm i config
- or install rc module -> npm i rc
## Debugging
- To run the file, redirect to the file containing the js file
- Then execute the code nodemon debug-index.js
- For every time we can not put console log to see the change
- we can put dubug point
- install debug package
- npm i debug
- Go to terminal
- export DEBUG=app:startup,app:db
- now nodemon debug-index.js
## Templating Engines
- Till now we are returning json response
- But in few cases we need to return text or html or something else
- For that we can use Templeting Engines
    - Pug
    - Mustache
    - EJS
    - These are the dynamically generate html template
- Now install pug => npm i pug
- app.set('view engine','pug');
- app.set('views','./views');  // default
- use above line to set the template as pug
- Now open template-index.js
- Redirect to the file
- type nodemon template-index.js
- in browser type http://localhost:3000/
- You will see the message you passed in that file, If you inspect the code of the page you will be able to see the codes

## Database Integration (http://expressjs.com/en/guide/database-integration.html)
-  You will see the supported Databases in node js in the above link
- Click on the database in the page 
- You will see the code to integrate in node js
