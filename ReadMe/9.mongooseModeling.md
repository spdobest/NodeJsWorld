# Mongoose Modeling relation between connections
## Modeling relationships
- As of now we have create only straigh forward schemas
- Where One Table independent on another table
- Lets asume a Course that have Author, which have multiple properties like name, age , authorType
- How can we link this another schema to the course schema
- We can do that using two ways
- **Using References ( Normalization) CONSISTENCY**
    - ```
        let author = {
            name: 'Siba'
        }
        let course = {
            authors:[
                'id1',
                'id2'
            ]
        }
    ```
    - In this abobe approach, a course have an array of authors which contains id's
    - In this approach, we have data consistency. because, in future if you will change the nae to Siba Prasad, we no need to change the authors. But the disadvantage is , for each course we need to query to gell co authors
- **Using embeded Documents (Denormalization) PERFORMANCE**
- This is nothing but putting one schema inside another
    - ```
            let course = {
                author:{
                    name: 'Siba',
                    bookPublished: 5
                }
            }
        ```
    - In this approach, course contain another object inside it.    
    - The advantage of this approach is - its much more faster as we no need to fetch author details
    - But if we will change the autohr name, we need to change other author documents as well    
- **Hybrid Approach**
    - ```
         let author = {
                    name: 'Siba'
                    // other properties
            }
         let course = {
             author:{
                 id: 'ref',
                 nae:'Siba'
             }
         }   
        ```
    - For ecomerse products, we will choose hybrid approach, because each have different schema
